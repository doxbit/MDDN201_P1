				<h3 class="bodyhead">Possible Advanced Transportation Controller</h3>
				<p class="bodytxt">This box was present on only a select few traffic lights, and was signifigantly larger than the smaller metal boxes above. This could be an ATC system, design to be able to do more advanced traffic management - such as allow emergency vehicles a green light. <br><br>
However it is impossible to know exactly the role of this box, without opening it up.

				<p class="bodytxt">These are the largest circular covers present in Wellington - often with multiple near each other. They are one of the largest companies responsible for maintaining physical infrasture in Wellington alongside Downer Connect.</p>

				<p class="bodytxt">These covers often were on sidewalks, rather than in streets like the Testra ones above. Again, it is very difficult to be certain what is underneath without opening it, but this could be a fibre access point for Chorus technicians, to begin connecting the community.
